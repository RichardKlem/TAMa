# Block cleaning
This app allows you to set locations where you are usually parking and get<br>
notifications about when the block cleaning is happening, so you can avoid<br>
getting fined or even being towed away!

## Motivation for app creation
 - Fine for removing a vehicle.
 - Lack of block cleaning signs.
 - Block cleaning dates must be sought for each Brno district separately.

## Google API
### How to add API key
In the file `local.properties` add this line of code at the end:<br>
```apiKey=<YOUR_API_KEY>```
